$Overview

The C++ Test Case Generator is a tool designed to streamline the process of generating test cases for C++ programs.
This project aims to simplify the testing phase by automating the creation of diverse test scenarios, helping developers 
ensure the robustness and correctness of their C++ code.

$Features
-> Random Test Cases: Generate random input values for your C++ program to cover a wide range of scenarios.

-> Custom Input: Specify custom input values for more targeted testing.

-> Output Validation: Verify the correctness of the output produced by your C++ program.

-> Batch Testing: Generate multiple test cases in a batch to assess program behavior under various conditions.
